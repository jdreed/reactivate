Description: Causes gdm logins to run in an ephemeral snapshot of the root
 This package causes each gdm login to run in a temporary copy of the
 root, so that any system modifications performed within the chroot
 are erased after logout.
 .
 This package is very much tailored to Athena cluster machines.  To
 use it, the machine MUST be installed so that the root partition is a
 logical volume inside a volume group with at least 21GB of free
 space.  This script will, in certain exceptional conditions, reboot
 the machine in order to be able to unmount the login snapshot.
