Attention: You are on a Debathena Quickstation. Quickstations have no
root password, so it is not possible to get root access. If you need
root access to a Debathena machine, you should be able to use any
cluster workstation.

If you would like a permanent change to cluster machines, please
report a bug via the "sendbug" command.
