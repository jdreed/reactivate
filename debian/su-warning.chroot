Attention: You are on a Debathena cluster machine. Although you can use
su to become root, your access is restricted to a sandbox (chroot)
created when you logged in. If you install software or change
global settings, they will be reverted when you log out.

If you would like a permanent change to cluster machines, please
report a bug via the "sendbug" command.

Run the command "tellme root" to find the current Athena root password.
